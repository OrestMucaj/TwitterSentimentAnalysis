# Assignment 2 - Artificial Intelligence (2025)

This code is part of **Assignment 2** for the **2025** academic year of the **Artificial Intelligence** in the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.

Assignment 2 uses pre-trained **GloVe** embeddings (`glove-twitter-200d`), which are fine-tuned during training,  to convert tweet text into dense vector representations, which are then passed to a **Feed Forward Neural Network** built with PyTorch for binary sentiment classification.

The PDF file `AI2_Homework2_2025.pdf` contains the assignment description and detailed instructions.

The PDF file `REPORT.pdf` includes a detailed report on the assignment.

The code is provided in the notebook file `Sentiment_Analysis_GloVe_Feed_Forward_Neural_Network.ipynb`.
